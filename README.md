Generating Amazon cover template for irregular sizes
Amazon kdp provides a tool online to generate cover template for book covers. https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/cover-templates<br><br>
However, this only allows for the creation of standard cover sizes and it becomes difficult to design a book cover for a book with irregular trim size. This python script creates the needed template and currently works on the console. It uses the dimensions of the trimsize, the number of pages and the interior type to generate the needed cover template in pdf for graphic designers to easily create cover designs for authors.<br><br>
To download an exe file of the script, navigate to the /dist/ folder in the /venv/ folder to access the "Template Generator.exe" for the executable file of the app if you do not have python running on your machine.
